# CSCI11_Sp26 - "*Your name*" Assignments

Repository for students to exchange homework with the instructor.

For *CSCI11*, there are **two** repositories:
* *CSCI11_Instructor* - **one** repository, which will be the **same** for **all** students. It is *public* and hosted on *github.com/lkoepsel*. It contains the assignments for each week.
* *CSCI11_Student* - **one** repository for **each** student, it is *private* and hosted on *github.com/student_username*. It contains each student's work on the weekly assignments.

### Important
1. **Please make sure your version of this repository on GitHub is private and is accessible by only the instructor and you.**
2. **Please do NOT make changes or add files to the *CSIS11_Instructor* folder, as this is where you will receive new versions of files from the instructor**
